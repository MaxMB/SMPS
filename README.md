# SMPS
Switch-Mode Power Supply design with variable voltage output and I-LQR/LQG state space digital controller.
This work is my Undergraduate Thesis for the course of Mechatronics Engineering at Poli-USP and it details the complete power electronics design and controller design of a precision SMPS with variable output.
Please, beggin your reading with the file "SMPS_LQR_LQG.pdf" or the final paper "SMPS_LQR_LQG_IEEE_Conference".
The design and simulation are done using Matlab and PSIM.
